### Steps to consider while running the app

1. Create a virtual environment
   `python -m venv venv`

2. Activate the virtual environment
   `source venv/Scripts/activate` (on windows)
   `source venv/bin/activate` (on linux based OS or MacOs)

3. Install packages
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Run the app
   python app.py

FYI: Make sure you have an XAMPP server running sql, and you have a database there called `student_db`
